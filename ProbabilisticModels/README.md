# Course 2: Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models

My solutions to the assignments in Course 2 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.



## Overview

[Week 1: Autocorrect](Autocorrect)

[Week 2: Part of Speech Tagging and Hidden Markov Models](POSTagging)

[Week 3: Autocomplete and Language Models](Autocomplete)

[Week 4: Word Embeddings with Neural Networks](WordEmbeddings)



## About This Course

In Course 2 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

- Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming,
- Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is vital for computational linguistics,
- Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and
- Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
