# Course 3: Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models

My solutions to the assignments in Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.



## Overview

[Week 1: Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling](SentimentWithDNN)

[Week 2: Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling](DeepNgrams)

[Week 3: LSTMs and Named Entity Recognition](NamedEntityRecognition)

[Week 4: Siamese Networks](QuestionDuplicates)



## About This Course

In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

- Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
- Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
- Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and
- Use so-called ‚ÄòSiamese‚Äô LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
