    "This assignment will be different from the two previous ones. Due to memory constraints of this environment and for the sake of time, your model will be trained with small datasets, so you won't get models that you could use in production but you will gain the necessary knowledge about how the Generative Language models are trained and used. Also you won't spend too much time with the architecture of the models but you will instead take a model that is pre-trained on a larger dataset and fine tune it to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this labs you will:\n",
    "* Understand how the C4 dataset is structured.\n",
    "* Pretrain a transformer model using a Masked Language Model.\n",
    "* Understand how the \"Text to Text Transfer from Transformers\" or T5 model works. \n",
    "* Fine tune the T5 model for Question answering\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started take some time to read the following tips:\n",
    "#### TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:\n",
    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions.\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",

    "### 1.1 - Pre-Training Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial phase of training a T5 model for a Question Answering task, the pre-training process involves leveraging a masked language model (MLM) on a very large dataset, such as the C4 dataset. The objective is to allow the model to learn contextualized representations of words and phrases, fostering a deeper understanding of language semantics. To initiate pre-training, it is essential to employ the Transformer architecture, which forms the backbone of T5. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh different parts of the input sequence dynamically, capturing long-range dependencies effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into pre-training, thorough data preprocessing is crucial. The C4 dataset, a diverse and extensive collection of web pages, provides a rich source for language understanding tasks. The dataset needs to be tokenized into smaller units, such as subwords or words, to facilitate model input. Additionally, the text is often segmented into fixed-length sequences or batches, optimizing computational efficiency during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the masked language modeling objective, a percentage of the tokenized input is randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the original content of these masked tokens. This process encourages the T5 model to grasp contextual relationships between words and phrases, enhancing its ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses during downstream tasks like question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the pre-training of the T5 model involves utilizing the Transformer architecture on a sizable dataset like C4, coupled with meticulous data preprocessing to convert raw text into a format suitable for training. The incorporation of a masked language modeling objective ensures that the model learns robust contextual representations, laying a solid foundation for subsequent fine-tuning on specific tasks such as question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The word \"mask\" will be used throughout this assignment in context of hiding/removing word(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be implementing the Masked language model (MLM) as shown in the following image. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/loss.png\" width=\"600\" height = \"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you have the following text: <span style = \"color:blue\"> **Thank you <span style = \"color:red\">for inviting </span> me to your party <span style = \"color:red\">last</span>  week** </span> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as input you will mask the words in red in the text: \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style = \"color:blue\"> **Input:**</span> Thank you  **X** me to your party **Y** week.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style = \"color:blue\">**Output:**</span> The model should predict the words(s) for **X** and **Y**. \n",

It is commonly used for various natural language processing tasks and machine learning research. Each sample in the C4 dataset follows a consistent format, making it suitable for pretraining models like BERT. Here's a short explanation and description of the C4 dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Format: Each sample in the C4 dataset is represented as a JSON object, containing several key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content: The 'text' field in each sample contains the actual text content extracted from web pages. This text often includes a wide range of topics and writing styles, making it diverse and suitable for training language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metadata: The dataset includes metadata such as 'content-length,' 'content-type,' 'timestamp,' and 'url,' providing additional information about each web page. 'Content-length' specifies the length of the content, 'content-type' describes the type of content (e.g., 'text/plain'), 'timestamp' indicates when the web page was crawled, and 'url' provides the source URL of the web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications: The C4 dataset is commonly used for training and fine-tuning large-scale language models, such as BERT. It serves as a valuable resource for tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, and more.\n",

    "- Size: The C4 dataset is containing more than 800 GiB of text data, making it suitable for training models with billions of parameters.\n",

I\\'ve done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won\\'t be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that\\'s mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\\nI\\'ve actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\\nThanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn\\'t fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.'} \n",

This will help the model to learn the general structure of language from a large dataset. This is much easier to do, as you don't need to label any data, but just use the masking, which is done automatically. You will then use the data from the SQuAD set to teach the model to answer questions given a context. To start let's review the Transformer's architecture. \n",

      "question:  What percentage of the vote was recorded as approving Napoleon's constitution? context: Napoleon established a political system that historian Martyn Lyons called \"dictatorship by plebiscite.\" Worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution, but unwilling to ignore them entirely, Napoleon resorted to regular electoral consultations with the French people on his road to imperial power. He drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII and secured his own election as First Consul, taking up residence at the Tuileries. The constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following January, with 99.94 percent officially listed as voting \"yes.\" Napoleon's brother, Lucien, had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite; the real number was 1.5 million. Political observers at the time assumed the eligible French voting public numbered about 5 million people, so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the Consulate. In the first few months of the Consulate, with war in Europe still raging and internal instability still plaguing the country, Napoleon's grip on power remained very tenuous.\n",
